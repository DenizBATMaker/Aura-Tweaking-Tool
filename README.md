# Aura-Tweaking-Tool

# Lisence key is "Aura"

Aura primary goal is to debloat Windows by disabling Telemetry, unnecessary services, and applying various tweaks to improve the user's performance! But why stop there? To become the best Free Ultimate Tweaking Utility, we must constantly be adding and implementing new features and discoveries. OneClick does more than just debloating; We have Latency tweaks, Network tweaks, Power tweaks, GPU tweaks, and more note this tweaker is fake so it will not do anything to your hardware!

# Usage

For the best and most favorably results, we recommend running Aura Tweaking Tool on a fresh/stock Windows 11 22H2 or 23H2 install; not 24H2. This way we can guarantee nothing conflicts with or interrupts Oneclick during the tweaking process! This however doesn't mean you're forced to use Windows 11 or a fresh/stock operating system just that it's recommended. We also recommend disabling/deactivating using Dcontrol to permanently disable windows defender, that way Aura Tweaking Tool can make the necessary changes in your system without windows defender blocking it. This often occurs with registy/system changes and maybe prevent Aura Tweaking Tool from being fully effective, although this is only a recommendation!

It's important to note that this tool is not a real tool so it dosent work its just for fun!
